# Deep Neural Networks from Scratch
This repository contains implementations of various deep neural network architectures employing purely Python and NumPy. The code is inspired by snippets from Andrew Ng's [Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.deeplearning.ai/courses/deep-learning-specialization/).
